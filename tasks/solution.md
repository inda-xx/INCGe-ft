# Solution

Here's a comprehensive solution for the task, which involves reading product sales data from a text file, processing it to calculate total sales per product, and storing the results in a `HashMap` for easy retrieval and display. This solution will help students understand file I/O operations, string manipulation, and the use of collections like `HashMap` in Java.

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class SalesDataAnalyzer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashMap to store product names and their respective total sales
        HashMap<String, Integer> salesMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Define the file path
        String filePath = "sales.txt";

        // Read and process the file
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            
            // Read the file line by line
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                // Split the line into parts; assume format is "ProductName,Sales"
                String[] productData = line.split(",");
                
                // Check if the line is properly formatted
                if (productData.length != 2) {
                    System.out.println("Skipping malformed line: " + line);
                    continue; // Skip to the next iteration
                }

                // Extract product name and sales figure
                String productName = productData[0].trim();
                int sales;
                
                try {
                    sales = Integer.parseInt(productData[1].trim());
                } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                    System.out.println("Skipping line with invalid sales number: " + line);
                    continue; // Skip to the next iteration
                }

                // Update the HashMap with cumulative sales
                salesMap.put(productName, salesMap.getOrDefault(productName, 0) + sales);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
            return;
        }

        // Output total sales statistics for each product
        System.out.println("Total Sales Per Product:");
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : salesMap.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **File Reading:**
   - We use `BufferedReader` to efficiently read the file line by line.
   - Each line is expected to contain data in the format `ProductName,Sales`.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - For each line, we split the line by a comma to extract `productName` and `sales`.
   - We ensure that the line is correctly formatted with a length check.
   - We use `try...catch` to handle potential `NumberFormatException` that might occur if sales data is not a valid integer.

3. **HashMap Utilization:**
   - `HashMap<String, Integer>` is used to store product names as keys and their cumulative sales as values.
   - We use `getOrDefault` to handle entries that are not yet in the map, initializing their value to 0 before adding sales.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, we iterate over the `HashMap` and print the total sales for each product, providing clear output that summarizes the file data.

This implementation ensures robust handling of file reading errors and malformed data, which are critical aspects of real-world applications.
