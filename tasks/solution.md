# Solution

Here's a solution to the task, including the Java class `TextAnalyzer` that reads a text file and analyzes word frequencies using a `HashMap`. The code is well-documented and follows Java best practices.

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class TextAnalyzer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "data.txt";
        HashMap<String, Integer> wordFrequencies = analyzeTextData(filePath);
        
        // Print out the top 5 most frequent words and their counts.
        wordFrequencies.entrySet().stream()
            .sorted((entry1, entry2) -> entry2.getValue().compareTo(entry1.getValue()))
            .limit(5)
            .forEach(entry -> System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue()));
        
        // Reflect on the performance and propose changes for handling larger datasets
        // Improvements might include parallel processing or using more memory-efficient data structures.
    }
    
    /**
     * Analyzes the text file to determine the frequency of each word.
     *
     * @param filePath Path to the input text file.
     * @return A HashMap with words as keys and their frequency as values.
     */
    private static HashMap<String, Integer> analyzeTextData(String filePath) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> wordCountMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Using try-with-resources to manage resources properly and handle IOExceptions.
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            // Read the file line-by-line
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                // Tokenize each line into words, assuming words are separated by spaces.
                // Additional logic might be needed to handle punctuation and different delimiters.
                String[] words = line.split("\\s+");
                for (String word : words) {
                    // Remove punctuation and convert to lower case for uniformity
                    word = word.replaceAll("\\W", "").toLowerCase();
                    if (!word.isEmpty()) {
                        // Use getOrDefault to simplify counting logic
                        wordCountMap.put(word, wordCountMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred while reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        return wordCountMap;
    }
}
```

### Key Learnings and Comments:

- **File I/O Operations:** 
  - Used `BufferedReader` with `FileReader` for efficient reading of text files. The try-with-resources statement ensures that resources are automatically closed, which prevents resource leaks.

- **HashMap Utilization:**
  - The `HashMap` is used to store word frequencies. Methods like `put()`, `getOrDefault()`, and `keySet()` are essential for managing map entries.
  - `getOrDefault(key, defaultValue)` provides a default value if the key is not found, which simplifies code for updating word counts.

- **Improving Performance for Large Datasets:**
  - While the solution efficiently handles moderately sized datasets, processing very large files could benefit from optimizations like parallelism (using streams or concurrency utilities) or more memory-efficient data structures.
  - Depending on the context, further enhancements such as lazy loading or database storage might be considered.

- **Documentation:** 
  - Java API documentation was crucial in understanding file operations and hash map methods. It is a valuable resource for finding method signatures and understanding their behavior.

This solution can be tested by placing a text file named `data.txt` in the appropriate path and executing the `TextAnalyzer` program. The top 5 most frequent words and their counts will be printed to the console.
