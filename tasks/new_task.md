### Task Description

### Exercise 1: Reading Data and Populating Data Structures

**Subject:** Arrays  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Skills:** Loops

#### Objective:
Enhance understanding of reading from text files and processing data using arrays and loops. This exercise integrates file I/O with data structures to simulate a real-world application.

#### Instructions:
1. **File Reading Setup:**
   - Use Java documentation to understand `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`.
   - Read a text file named `students.txt`, containing student names and scores.
   - Format: `Name,Score` (e.g., `Alice,85`).

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Initialize arrays to store names and scores.
   - Ensure proper handling of arrays when reading the data.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Use loops to populate arrays with the data from the file.
   - Calculate the average score and identify the highest and lowest scores.

4. **Output Results:**
   - Display the average score, highest and lowest scores, and respective students.

#### Key Requirements:
- Implement proper exception handling and resource management using try-with-resources.
- Use Java documentation for any class or method clarification.

#### Expected Learning Outcomes:
- Navigate Java documentation to implement file I/O.
- Use loops to process and analyze data.
- Develop error-handling techniques for robust applications.

### Exercise 2: Implementing a Student Management System with HashMaps

**Subject:** Hashing Algorithms  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Skills:** Hash Maps

#### Objective:
Develop a comprehensive understanding of `HashMap` through the creation of a student management system. This exercise enhances the ability to manage complex data and solve problems with advanced data structures.

#### Instructions:
1. **HashMap Initialization:**
   - Create a `HashMap<String, Integer>` to store student names and scores.
   - Utilize Java documentation to explore `HashMap` methods.

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Populate the `HashMap` with data read from the `students.txt` file.
   - Implement a function for efficient data insertion and retrieval.

3. **Advanced Operations:**
   - Develop methods to add, remove, and update student records.
   - Implement a search function to retrieve data for a given student.
   - Explore hash functions and understand collision handling.

4. **Application Features:**
   - Allow users to interact with the system through a simple text-based interface.
   - Include options for viewing all records, editing scores, and adding new entries.

5. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Analyze the efficiency of operations and discuss hash function impact.
   - Consider edge cases and ensure reliable data management.

#### Key Requirements:
- Demonstrate the use of API references for `HashMap` operations.
- Integrate community resources to explore best practices in hash functions.

#### Expected Learning Outcomes:
- Master the use of `HashMap` for data management.
- Implement efficient algorithms for data storage and retrieval.
- Simulate industry-relevant scenarios within Java applications.
