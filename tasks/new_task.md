### Task Description

## Exercise 1: Analyzing Data from Arrays

- **Subject**: Arrays
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Skills**: Loops

### Description
In this exercise, students will use loops to process and analyze data stored in arrays. They will simulate a real-world scenario by calculating statistical information from a data set.

### Tasks
1. Create an array of integers containing a set of temperature readings.
2. Implement a loop to calculate the average temperature.
3. Use nested loops to find and count occurrences of temperature values exceeding a certain threshold.

### Hint
```java
int[] temperatures = {30, 32, 28, 35, 31, 33};
for (int temp : temperatures) {
    // Process each temperature reading
}
```

## Exercise 2: Implementing a Custom Hashing Algorithm

- **Subject**: Hashing algorithms
- **Difficulty**: Very Hard
- **Skills**: Hashing algorithms

### Description
This advanced exercise tasks students with designing and implementing a custom hashing algorithm, focusing on hash function construction and collision handling, essential for understanding data structures.

### Tasks
1. Design a hashing algorithm to efficiently map strings to integers.
2. Implement collision resolution using open addressing or separate chaining.
3. Test the algorithm's performance with various input datasets.

### Hint
```java
int customHash(String input) {
    int hash = 0;
    for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
        // Calculate hash value using character manipulation
    }
    return hash;
}
```

2. Simulate a simple game using these random numbers.
3. Calculate the frequency distribution of outcomes.

### Hint
```java
Random random = new Random();
int roll = random.nextInt(6) + 1; // Simulate a dice roll
```
